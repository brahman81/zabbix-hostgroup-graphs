Description: This library attempts to work around the inability to create graphs with items from multiple Zabbix host-groups.  
If you are using this library, drop me a line it will put a smile on my face :)  

Also facilitates creating a graph for all items in a Zabbix Application. ex: application-graph.pl

Quick Start on OSX:  
```bash
git clone git@github.com:brahman81/zabbix-hostgroup-graphs.git ~/
sudo ln -s ~/scripts/perl/zabbix-hostgroup-graphs/Zabbix /Library/Perl/5.12/Zabbix
```
